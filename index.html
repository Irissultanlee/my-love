    <p>My dear kareemat I’m writing this to express my sincere love to you and I pray almighty Allah strength our bond and enrich you and I with  beneficial knowledge, halal income ,sustenance,tranquility and everything good in this world and the hereafter.<p/>
      <p>My dear kareemat I promise to love you for the sake of my creator, my lord the originator of all things, I’m choosing to not just love you for my own sake but for the sake of Allah so I can always do right by you in good & bad times.<p/>
          <p>this world is but a test I pray you and I pass our test in this world and I pray you and I are amongst those whom Allah has destined jannah for.
        Amin.</p>

  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
